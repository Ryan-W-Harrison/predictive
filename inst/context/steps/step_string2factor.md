## `step_string2factor()`

Converts character columns to factors. Note: It's generally better to convert strings to factors *before* using a recipe.

Arguments:
* `levels`: An optional character vector of levels. If `NULL`, levels are inferred from the data.
* `ordered`: A logical indicating whether the resulting factor should be ordered. Not tunable.
