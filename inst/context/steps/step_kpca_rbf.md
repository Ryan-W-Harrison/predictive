## `step_kpca_rbf()`

Extracts nonlinear principal components using a radial basis function kernel. This is computationally intensive.

Arguments:
* `num_comp`: The number of components to retain. This argument is tunable.
* `sigma`: The radial basis function parameter. This argument is tunable.
* `prefix`: A character string for the prefix of the resulting new variables.
* `keep_original_cols`: A logical to keep the original variables in the output.
